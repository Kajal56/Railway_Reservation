1) in my-bookings, at both places, past_bookings has been written because we don't have data for future dates, have to fix this. by adding advance dates to the database (in classeats basically) and then booking. (ughhh)
2) "Invalid options object. Dev Server has been initialized using an options object that does not match the API schema.
 - options.allowedHosts[0] should be a non-empty string." 
   --------Due to internet problem.
3) Got to see useEffect in SearchRes, at this point of time, we have to refresh before giving new input, but that should be corrected.
4) have to change AuthApi according things in App.js :)
5) have to clean App.js and move mess to some other file
